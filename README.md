# Minecraft-AutoHitter
Created 6/18/2021 by Henry Hall for Python 3.7.3 on Windows.
Module Dependencies: time, pyautogui
Minecraft dependencies: skeleton or zombie spawner farm as in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEMuNX0ru6Q
It might work for other farms as well, just make sure you're safe to afk and you can hit the mobs.

## Usage:
1. Stand in front of the area where mobs fall.
2. Put food in hand so that the script will be able to eat.
3. Start script.
4. Enter Minecraft window, aim to where you want to hit.
5. Make sure that the script is hitting mobs.
6. Allow to run as long as you want.
7. Follow directions below to end script.

## Ending script:
To end script take focus away from Minecraft window by hitting exit, and move cursor to a corner of the screen for several seconds.
Make sure that you don't try to end the script while it is eating or it will not release the right mouse button and the mouse will become unresponsive in Minecraft. If that happens then restart the script, wait until it is running properly again and retry ending the script.

## Future updates:
I will be testing possible solutions to the right mouse button becoming unresponsive, and adding popups to confirm when the script has started and when it ends.
